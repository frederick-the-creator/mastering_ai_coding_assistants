# Initial User Stories for AI-Powered Brainstorming and Journaling App

## User Story 1: Project Setup with Core Dependencies

**As a** developer  
**I want to** set up the initial project structure with the core Vue.js framework and dependencies  
**So that** I have a working foundation to build the journaling app upon

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Initialize a new Vue.js 3 project using Vue CLI or Vite
- Install and configure the following dependencies with exact versions:
  - Vue: 3.3.4
  - Vuetify: 3.3.15
  - Vue Router: 4.2.5
  - Pinia: 2.1.6
  - VeeValidate: 4.11.8
  - Axios: 1.5.1
- Configure Vuetify with a basic material design theme
- Set up the basic folder structure for components, views, and store
- Ensure the app builds and runs without errors

**Technical Notes:**
- Use the following command to install dependencies with exact versions:
- This is a local-only application with no external API dependencies as per requirement DM-1

## User Story 2: Create Basic App Shell with Navigation

**As a** user  
**I want to** see a basic app interface with navigation  
**So that** I can navigate between different sections of the app

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a main app layout with Vuetify components including:
- App bar with the app title "AI Journal"
- Navigation drawer with placeholder menu items for "Home", "Journal Entries", and "Settings"
- Main content area with a router view
- Implement basic routing with Vue Router for the placeholder pages
- Display a welcome message on the home page: "Welcome to AI Journal - Your AI-powered brainstorming and journaling app!"
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Vuetify's v-app, v-app-bar, v-navigation-drawer, and v-main components for the layout
- Implement routes in a separate router file using Vue Router 4.2.5
- This satisfies the initial structure for UI-1 and UI-2 requirements

## User Story 3: Set Up Basic State Management

**As a** developer  
**I want to** implement basic state management  
**So that** the app can manage and display simple data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Set up Pinia store with a basic journal entries module
- Create a simple data structure for journal entries with:
- ID
- Title
- Content
- Date created
- Tags array
- Add placeholder data with 2-3 sample journal entries
- Display the sample entries on the Journal Entries page in a simple list or card format
- Add a simple form with validation that shows the concept of creating a new entry (doesn't need to persist)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Pinia 2.1.6 for state management
- Implement VeeValidate 4.11.8 for the simple form validation
- This sets up the foundation for requirements DM-2 and EO-1
- No actual data persistence is required at this stage (just in-memory)
