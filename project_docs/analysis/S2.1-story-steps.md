# Story S2.1 Implementation Steps

## Story: Implement Rich Text Editor for Journal Entries
As a user, I want to format my journal entries with basic text styling so that I can better express my thoughts and organize my content.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1. Add a rich text editor component to the project
Must Support:
- Installation of a Vue-compatible rich text editor library
- Registration of the component in the Vue application
- Basic configuration of the editor component
Manual Verification:
- Verify the editor component is properly installed
- Check that the component can be imported in Vue files
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Research Vue-compatible WYSIWYG editors that work well with Vue 3
- Consider bundle size and performance impact when selecting a library
- Ensure the library is actively maintained and has good documentation

### Step 2. Replace textarea with rich text editor in NewEntryForm
Must Support:
- Replacing v-textarea with the rich text editor component
- Configuring basic formatting options (bold, italic, underline, headings, lists)
- Maintaining the same form layout and responsiveness
Manual Verification:
- Open the form and verify the rich text editor appears
- Test each formatting option to ensure it works
- Verify the editor is responsive on different screen sizes
Prerequisite: Step 1
Developer Notes:
- Maintain the same label and validation structure
- Configure only the necessary formatting options to keep the interface clean
- Ensure the editor height is appropriate for journal entries

### Step 3. Update form submission to handle formatted content
Must Support:
- Capturing HTML content from the rich text editor
- Sanitizing HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- Submitting the sanitized HTML to the Pinia store
Manual Verification:
- Create a journal entry with formatting
- Check the console/network to verify the correct data is being sent
- Verify no errors occur during submission
Prerequisite: Step 2
Developer Notes:
- Use a HTML sanitizer to clean user input
- Consider how to handle empty content (e.g., just whitespace or empty tags)
- Ensure validation still works with HTML content

### Step 4. Update Pinia store to handle HTML content
Must Support:
- Storing HTML content in the journal entries
- Retrieving HTML content for display
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing entries
Manual Verification:
- Check that formatted entries are correctly stored in the Pinia store
- Verify existing plain text entries still display correctly
Prerequisite: Step 3
Developer Notes:
- Consider adding a content type flag to distinguish between plain text and HTML
- Ensure the store can handle larger content sizes due to HTML markup

### Step 5. Update JournalEntryCard to display formatted content
Must Support:
- Rendering HTML content safely
- Preserving formatting in the card view
- Handling potential overflow issues with formatted content
Manual Verification:
- View a list of journal entries with formatting
- Verify formatting appears correctly in the cards
- Check that different formatting types (bold, lists, etc.) display properly
Prerequisite: Step 4
Developer Notes:
- Use Vue's v-html directive with sanitized content
- Consider how to handle very long formatted content in cards
- Ensure consistent styling between the editor and the displayed content
